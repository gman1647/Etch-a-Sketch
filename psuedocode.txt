Just a sketch of how I think I might do this:

First Step: the grid
Create a container div in html
create a function (maybe?) to add one square
Loop it to create 16
Add them to the DOM using js 
Grid should be about 960px

check out CSS Grid to see how we might make them line up

Second step: the hover
create a hover function with an event listner for hover
add css tags for hover that changes the squares color
Play a bit with the colors and color selections

Add a but to promt for number of squares per side
Grid should always fit in the same size pad (no idea how to do this)
    limit input to 100
    check out button tags and prompts
    The pixels of any size should fit in the same grid

Other stuff:
color picker
rainbow colors
add increasing darker colors after each pass through
add a pixel slider
